# About
- Created a bot using Telegramâ€™s BotFather and used Telegram API in Java to
provide a song download link to the user, taking the name of the song as input
from user through the bot.
- Scraped the download link for the song in Google Search using Selenium
framework and JSoup and sent it back to the user through the telegram bot.
- Took approx. 1 sec per cycle.
